# Build and Deploy Your Own ChatGPT AI SaaS Business with React


## Introduction
In this project, I built a ReactJS application using Vite, Tailwind CSS, and RTK Query. The application is a simple todo list that allows users to create, edit, and delete todo items.

I also learned how to:

Set up a ReactJS project using Vite
Create a responsive, beautiful UI/UX with a nice touch of glass morphism using Tailwind CSS
Make advanced RTK query API requests that fire on condition
Save history using the local storage
Handle form events and catch errors
Implement copy to clipboard
Write clean code
